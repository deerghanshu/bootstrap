        <h2> Basics of Machine Learning </h2>
        <p>
            <b>What is machine learning?</b><br>
            Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become
            more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning
            algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.<br>

            Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning. Other popular uses include fraud
            detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection, business process automation (BPA) and predictive
            maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Why is machine learning important?</b><br>
            Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and
            business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading
            companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations.
            Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What are the different types of machine learning?</b><br>
            Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its
            predictions. There are four basic approaches:supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised
            learning and reinforcement learning. The type of algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what
            type of data they want to predict.
